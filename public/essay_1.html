    <h1>Corporate Happiness</h1>
  
    <p>This essay sprung out of a conversation with my business partner. For context, I studied law at the London School of Economics for three years before deciding to start a AI business. Whilst this decision emerged from my summers contemplating what I'd do with my life, it was my internship at the law firm Goodwin Procter that sealed the deal (in deciding to do a startup).</p>
  
    <p>If you're not a law student, you may not be aware that Goodwin is the world's premier law firm specialising in technology. Their clients include names like Y Combinator, OpenAI and Microsoft and so naturally a culture of entrepreneurship and innovation is imbued in the firm's ethos.</p>
  
    <p>From the first day of the internship I sought answers. Why is the firm structured in the way it is? What makes Goodwin important? More importantly, why do we so strongly enforce these AI regulations if our goal is to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation?</p>
  
    <p>The latter question was the subject of a heated discussion between myself and a senior associate. I argued that lawyers are narrow-minded and their expertise on complying with regulations is misconstrued as innovation. She argued that safety and due process always took priority over technical progress (hence her siding with the need to strongly enforce regulations). This was my first taste into why corporate happiness could be a facade.</p>
  
    <p>At this point in the internship I mentally checked out. I felt as if the 'innovative' culture of the firm had been mispresented to me, because the unfortunate focus of business in the UK and Europe is complying with regulatory challenges. None of these lawyers write code, and certainly none of them had faced the pain of customers not caring about their technology. It's easy to side with due process and rule-based innovation when you aren't the one creating the technology.</p>
  
    <p>The last day had arrived, and my final partner interview was due. I figured I would leave the internship knowing whether these senior lawyers are happy with their way of business. Most of my peers asked their interviewers about the firm's culture, the kinds of work they'd be expected to perform and what the hardest part of the job was. I only had one important question that needed answering. I asked my interviewing partner (the head member of the recruitment team): "Would you say you're happy"?</p>
  
    <p>She was surprised as expected, replying that's the first she'd been asked that question. Then she described how she often puts up with a borderline inhumane number of hours, and extremely stressful transactions when her clients require urgent attention. She described how her happiness stemmed not from the brutal stress of her work but the reward of suffering through it with her peers. For me (a nearly fresh graduate), the answer did not seem to indicate a convincing enough 'yes' to my question and it was at that point I realised a new strain of happiness most professional service workers trick themselves into chasing: "corporate happiness".</p>
