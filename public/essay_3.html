    <h1>Corporate Happiness</h1>
    <p>Europe is a depressing place to build technology products, and in recent years, most have come to agree. Having lived in London and soaked up the European approach to innovation for three years, I quickly realised that the region's history sheds useful light on why this is so.</p>

    <p>If you tell a friend your business idea in most European countries, their first instinct will be to question the long-run viability of your business, how feasible your technology is etcâ€¦ In the United States, that same person is more likely to look for ways in which your idea can come to fruition and be a force in the world if successful. The American Dream relies on every working-class individual believing they can be a millionaire, whilst Europe's history is rooted in robust regulatory enforcement.</p>
    
    <p>Take the Cold War for example; Germany served as a battleground between the Soviets and Americans given the strict need to prevent recurring warfare post-WW2. There was a strict sense of embedding conformity to regulations and securing lasting peace, whilst America focused on becoming a global superpower. People in Europe are very focused on preserving their rights and 'getting the most' out of the law.</p>
    
    <p>This inherently punishes innovators, because most large-scale innovation in America came from extending legal grey areas (take Facebook playing with their users' privacy, or Airbnb introducing the foreign concept of staying in strangers' homes, or Uber straddling along the grey area of hopping into strangers' cars). These ideas presented ethical questions at their inception but turned out to satisfy large-scale consumer demand in the long run, hence their success. I would bet that none of these ideas could possibly take off in Europe, where people are less open to finding newer (yet questionable) ways of conducting economic trade.</p>
    
    <p>Finally, a note on the UK. I suspect the UK has immense potential to be more innovative, however much of the infrastructure should change. The UK is home to Sir Tim Berners-Lee (founder of the World Wide Web), Google's DeepMind and two of the greatest technical universities in the world (Oxbridge). The reason for the UK's stagnation in technology compared to the US is because there is instilled in it a deep service-based economy, so most technical ideas do not extend beyond these sectors (i.e. finance, retail, hospitality). Examples of great technical successes include: Revolut (pioneering digital finance), the mass adoption of self-service ordering and AI kiosks (at least in London).</p>
