    <p>Starting TalentLex made me realise the only useful skill that matters in any kind of startup is adapting to black-swan events. This in itself is somewhat paradoxical - see below.</p>
  
    <p>A quick definition of what black swan events are: &apos;rare and unexpected events with severe consequences with the potential to cause a change in a formerly held belief or system of beliefs&apos;.</p>
  
    <p>In Nassim Nicholas Taleb&apos;s book, black swans are described as rare events that only occur due to the fact that we consider them unlikely. 9/11 was a black swan event, because no one expected a terrorist attack on the twin towers and the Indian Ocean Pacific Tsunami in 2004 was a black swan, because no one could have predicted a natural disaster of such scale.</p>
  
    <p>When you write code in anticipation of users, all sorts of unexpected things happen: the code breaks, no one cares and you get less users than expected using the product. The default state of operation is silence; this makes revenue that much more of a dopamine rush, because it is such a rare event. But if one were to take the advice of successful startup incubators like Y Combinator and optimise for revenue from day 1, is there such a thing as a black swan in a startup at all?</p>
  
    <p>In a recent video (as of this date) by Dalton Caldwell and Michael Seibel, the idea of the &apos;hedonic treadmill&apos; was explored. This is the idea that we adapt to life&apos;s circumstances regardless of the situation: bad or good. Therefore one might argue startup founders are the only group of people resistant to the extreme effects of black swan events, because the unexpected occurs on a daily basis.</p>
  
    <p>Rather, I have learned an alternative truth: it is your job as a founder to chase black swans, because they are the best indicator that you are moving in some direction. In a society where starting a business is glorified, black swans are not the same as they were 20 years ago and so chasing smaller markets or building seemingly unfeasible tech should seem like a rarity, because they are all signs of doing something different.</p>
